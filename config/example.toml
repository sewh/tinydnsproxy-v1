# The 'bind' section tells us how to listen for DNS on the
# local network. 'host' is the IP to bind on ('0.0.0.0' for
# all interfaces or '127.0.0.1' for just the local machine.)
# Port is the UDP port to listen on.

# The 'block_lists' section contains config that's general to
# all block lists. Specifically, there are the following parameters:
#
# * refresh_after :: How long (in minutes) to wait before refreshing
#   the block lists.

# The block list details the location and type of a block
# list to use. tinydnsproxy currently supports:
#
# * Local files :: 'list_type' should be 'file' and 'path'
#   should point at the location on disk of the file.
#
# There are a few different file formats we support. 'hosts',
# which is the format of hosts.txt files (e.g. entry on each
# line, each entry is [IP to redirect to] [hostname]). The
# other format is 'one-per-line' in which there's one domain
# per line to block. All formats permit '#' comments.

# The DNS server blocks detail upstream DNS-over-TLS resolvers.
# The 'ip_address' and 'port' describes how to create a TCP
# connection with the resolving service. The 'hostname' is used
# in the TLS handshake and must be correspond to the common name
# (or 'CN') of the X.509 certificate we receive back. If it doesn't
# line up then the TLS connection will be terminated because the
# remote resolver isn't trusted.
